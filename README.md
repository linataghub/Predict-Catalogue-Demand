# Predict-Catalogue-Demand

The company manufactures and sells high-end home goods. Last year the company sent out its first print catalog, and is preparing to send out this year's catalog in the coming months. The company has 250 new customers from their mailing list that they want to send the catalog to. 

We want to determine how much profit the company can expect from sending a catalog to these customers. Management does not want to send the catalog out to these new customers unless the expected profit contribution exceeds $10,000.
